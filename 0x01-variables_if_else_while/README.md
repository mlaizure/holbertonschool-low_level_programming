- 0: used if else statment to display whether random ints were positive or negative
- 1: used modulus and if statements to evaluate the last digit of a number
- 2: used a for loop and putchar to print out lowercase alphabet
- 3: used two for loops and putchar to print out lowercase then uppercase alphabet
- 4: used a for loop and logical and relational operators to print out lowercase alphabet excluding q and e
- 5: used a for loop and printf to print 0 - 9
- 6: used a for loop and putchar to print 0 - 9
- 7: used a for loop and putchar to print the alphabet backwards
- 8: used two for loops and putchar to print all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase
- 9: used a for loop and if else statement to print 0 - 9 with commas and spaces inbetween
- 10: used a for loop and if else statement to print all numbers from 00 -99 with commas and spaces inbetween
- 11: used a lot of unnecessary modular math to exlude non-unique two number combinations
- 12: this time the modular math made it easier to exclude non-unique three number combinations
- 13: used nested for loops to print unique combinations of two two-digit numbers
